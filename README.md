# DARE-ML: A Machine Learning Job Profiling Framework for Optimized Resource Usage

## Overview
**DARE-ML** is a machine learning (ML) job profiling framework designed to optimize resource usage and reduce energy consumption while accelerating model training times. By integrating an ESN-based loss estimator and monitoring tool, DARE-ML enables significant reductions in user waiting times, as well as energy savings, even under heavy computational loads. This framework aims to make AI development more sustainable and accessible, particularly in resource-constrained environments like smaller research units or institutions with limited access to large-scale computational resources.

## Key Features
- **Energy Saving**: Significantly reduces energy consumption by optimizing the use of computational resources during model training.
- **Accelerated Model Training**: Reduces model training time through intelligent profiling and loss-aware interruption of training jobs.
- **Flexible Scheduling**: Incorporates performance optimization alongside job scheduling to minimize operational costs and waiting times.
- **Sustainability Impact**: Aims to reduce the environmental footprint of high-performance AI research by focusing on energy efficiency and optimized resource management.

## Installation

To install **DARE-ML**, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites
Ensure that the following dependencies are installed:
- Python 3.x
- Required Python packages (listed below)
- Supported hardware for ML training (e.g., GPUs, TPUs)

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DARE-ML.git
cd DARE-ML
```

### Install Dependencies

You can install the required Python dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

DARE-ML is designed to be simple to use and integrate into your existing machine learning workflows.

### Basic Workflow

1. **Profiling**: Start by profiling your ML job using DARE-ML to estimate energy consumption and training time.
2. **Loss Estimation**: Use the ESN-based loss estimator to monitor and predict the loss behavior during training.
3. **Interrupt Training**: Configure the system to interrupt training jobs at the right time, reducing energy waste.
4. **Monitor Resource Usage**: The framework continuously tracks resource usage and adjusts the scheduling to optimize energy efficiency and training time.

### Example Command

```bash
python run_dareshml.py --model your_ml_model --train_data your_train_data --evaluate --optimize_resources
```

This command will run the model training with DARE-MLâ€™s energy optimization and performance monitoring tools enabled.

## Results

- **Average User Waiting Time**: Decreased by ~15% when retraining models up to overfitting.
- **Energy Consumption**: Reduced by up to 60 times in favorable scenarios, especially during training interruptions.
- **Sustainability**: Significant reduction in environmental impact by optimizing hardware resource usage.

## Future Work

We plan to enhance DARE-ML by implementing several key improvements:
- **Adaptive Scheduling**: To respond dynamically to workload fluctuations and hardware availability.
- **Expanded Model Support**: Adding compatibility with more ML model architectures and distributed training setups.
- **Predictive Models**: To better forecast resource demands and reduce job queuing delays.
- **Renewable Energy Integration**: Exploring energy management strategies that incorporate renewable energy sources to further reduce environmental impact.
